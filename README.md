# BLOCKCHAIN VOTING SYSTEM (WEB 3.O)

## Introduction
Before diving into the agenda, lets know what is blockchain. In general, Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. It is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network.

The purpose of the blockchain is to share information amongst all parties that access it via an application. Access to this ledger in terms of reading and writing may be unrestricted ('permissionless'), or restricted ('permissioned').

Blockchain technology was developed to address these problems, and it now provides decentralized nodes for electronic voting. Electronic voting systems are created using blockchain technology primarily because to the benefits of end-to-end verification.

## Features

## System Building Process
 i) Frontend [React JS, Bootstrap, Vite]
   1. Create two folder name a). Client.    b).Smart_Contract
      - Open these 2 folder in your favourite code editor.
      - Got to the client folder.            ``` cd client```
 
   2. Init the react project 
      - Run the command on terminal:    ``` create-react-app project_name || npm init vite@latest ```
      - Then install your favourite package for frontend like.    ``` npm i bootstrap@latest ```
   
   3. Start designing frontend part
   
   
  ii). Smart Contracts.     [Solidity, Crypto]
    1.  Go to the Smart_Contract folder.       ``` cd smart_contract ```
    2. Init the project using.  ``` npm init ```
